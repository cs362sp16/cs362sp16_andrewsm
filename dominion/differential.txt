It's not easy to figure out whose implamentation is correct.
Since we know neither are correct this test is failed due to something false can't prove something else false.
Differential testing in essince is supposed to work with something that has already been verified to work by other means.
Thus, more testing outside of differential should be done before diff testing is done.
