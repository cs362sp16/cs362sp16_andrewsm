All of the tests pass... When they shoulden't. Quite a few are purely giving the correct result as the game is initialized but never played.
Hence we are testing the null cass. Thus logically it passes without there actually being causality.
In mathematics this is to say
Q: We play dominion
P: The test passes
Q->P (Q implies P)
While the truth table is indeterminante for some cases as our tests don't work the table holds and passes all tests for
Q = false and P = true. Thus, most of our results are useless unless the code passed 100% coverage AND all given parameters are set to MEANINGFUL data.
This is hard to assume though as out tests are still valid on the null case to verify that they don't break the null case.
