These random tests are all alike as they are similar to the start of playdom.
However, then they just give the player the card they need, and then play the card.
This ten tests before and after conditions that should show if the card works or not.
All tests are getting around the same coverage and some tests are preforming in strange ways.
Most all tests are failing due to the carsd not working properly and some of the design failures from how the game state is managed.
I tried to improve a few of the tests but when the carsd im testing are so broken it's hard to figure out how to test them better.
Quite a few cards are already hitting 100% coverage on the cards and the test branches.
I feel this would give better results on a better built system with more quasi stable outpouts.
